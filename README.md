# Welcome to HelloJenkinsFromReactNative 👋

What if we setup an awesome pipeline for a react native project using Jenkins? 🚀

## Purpose 🤓

This is a basic project written in RN to be used by one instance of Jenkins. The idea is to cover basics of the pipeline. For instance, what should come in a great CI/CD pipeline? Things like tests, test coverage report, quality metrics, distribution channels and so on, right? 🤔

Don't expect much from this repo, tho. Here's a bootstrap for helping configure a new machine (mac mini?) with Jenkins: https://gist.github.com/tsainte/ac7e45884f28cb9e265e4bb888e45bf3

## To run the project 🏃‍

- `npm install react-native-cli`
- `react-native run-ios` or
- `react-native run-android`

## TODO ✅‍
- Everything 😹
